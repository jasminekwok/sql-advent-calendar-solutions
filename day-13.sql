-- Table Schema:
-- Table: behavior_scores
--   record_id: INTEGER
--   child_name: VARCHAR
--   behavior_score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

(SELECT child_name, behavior_score
FROM behavior_scores 
ORDER BY behavior_score
LIMIT 1)
UNION ALL 
(SELECT child_name, behavior_score
FROM behavior_scores 
ORDER BY behavior_score DESC
LIMIT 1);
