-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL

-- My Solution:

SELECT resort_name, 
  NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY annual_snowfall DESC) AS quartile_group
FROM (
SELECT resort_name, 
  AVG(snowfall_inches) as annual_snowfall
FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
GROUP BY resort_name) AS annual_resort_report
